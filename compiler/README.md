This language provides facilties that operate on an object and their values. It does not provide any type of direct access to raw storage. Therefore, it is not possible to reinterpret an interger object as a sequence of bytes. In this compiler, an object is definied as a region of storage that is created by a variable declaration or made as a result of a value computation. A program is able to destroy, refrences, access, create, and modify objects. Objects called stored objects are objects that are created by a declaration. Each stored object has a memory location that may be used to refer to that specific object. Any type of object that is created by a computute are known as temporary objects. Temporary objects are not stored.

How an object is represented is based on its type.
